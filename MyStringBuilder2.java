// Read this class and its comments very carefully to make sure you implement
// the class properly.  Note the items that are required and that cannot be
// altered!  Generally speaking you will implement your MyStringBuilder using
// a singly linked list of nodes.  See more comments below on the specific
// requirements for the class.

// For more details on the general functionality of most of these methods, 
// see the specifications of the similar method in the StringBuilder class.

	// See details of CNode class below.  In other words, you MAY NOT add
	// any additional instance variables to this class.  However, you may
	// use any method variables that you need within individual methods.
	// But remember that you may NOT use any variables of any other
	// linked list class or of the predefined StringBuilder or 
	// or StringBuffer class in any place in your code.  You may only use the
	// String class where it is an argument or return type in a method.

							// method
